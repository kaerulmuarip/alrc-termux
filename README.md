# <| alrc-termux | automations with .bash_profile |>

NAME
----
Alrc-termux is a sourceable file like .bashrc but separate from it. 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Used for interactive login automation purposes that will display the information of your device when opening a terminal session (Termux). 
It was originally created to replace user customization .bashrc but now there's no need to do that anymore. Just call through the source in .bashrc or .bash_profile.

B. Other Platform Termux based
------------------------------

  If you install alrc-termux in another place like fork termux. You can replace/remove the shebang! so you can continue the installation process. But it is highly recommended to install it in Termux environment

USAGE
-----

### usage:

Copy the following code snippet, paste it into the terminal. This will add the configuration directly to your .bash_profile

```text
echo ' export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:/system/bin" ' >> ~/.bash_profile

echo ' source <(~/.local/bin/alrc env)> /dev/null 2>&1; ' >> ~/.bash_profile

echo ' al;' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

```text

chsh -s bash && login      change to bash shell and exit

whatisal                   print this help message and return
```

### Templates
> Use the templates folder for config recommendations

### Test & Testing
#### test
> GUI: Test with the termux widget. If you don't want to mess up your .bash_profile, put the file ~/local/share/alrc-termux/test/.shortcuts/alrc.test To ~/.shortcuts/alrc.test Then make the Termux widget run from there, if it doesn't show up do the refresh.

> CLI: shot on terminal with 

```
bash ~/.shortcuts/alrc.test 
```

#### testing

- [x] Termux
- [ ] AndroidIDE (Terminal) But some gui features and features that require fire extinguishers won't work.
- [ ] Nix-on-droid But some gui features and features that require fire extinguishers won't work.
- [ ] Proot-distro (Experimental)
- [ ] Replit (Just for testing purposes)
- [ ] Wayland (Not working Alif said)

BUGS
----
- The al option, namely al_ab, cannot be exported to environment variables. I don't know why that can.
- On my device The imjpgrand automation feature won't consistently select the image viewer even if I press "Select always" in the end the solution was that one of the apps had to be uninstalled. I kept the zarchiver viewer and deleted the other one.
- Other Brandomusic variants cannot be combined with animation.sh, except BrandomusicX.
- Be careful installing other dotfiles, it can cause unwanted bugs/errors due to misconfiguration. first uninstall alrc-termux if you want to try using other dotfiles. termux-desktop causes imjpgrand to not work and other weird bugs.

- Cannot playing song in app com.miui.player latest version (recomendation version com.miui.player v6.4.20i)



ROADMAP
-------
I'd like to add more plugins for upcoming updates.
